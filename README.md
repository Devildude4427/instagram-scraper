# Instagram-Scraper

This project exists to be a tool that I can use (or give to others, who need it) and as a learning exercise. Originally, I needed a better tool to quickly gather post images, for another tool I was building. The alternatives that already existed seemed to be quite poor, or simply no longer maintained. Since then, I've expanded this from a project written in JS and ran via the terminal into a fully fledged C# application with a GUI. My continued goal is to create the fastest, most lightweight tool for scraping Instagram that exists. 

As of now, future plans for the project include smart text capture/download, and better error handling. While I've done what I can to ensure the program will not crash, little information is given back to the user, which I'd like to change. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for use.

Current options/abilities of the program:

- Gather all post images made by a user
- Gather all current stories made by a user
- Gather all comments made on a user's posts (including their bio)
