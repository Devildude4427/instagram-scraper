This project exists to be a tool that I can use (or give to others, who need it) and as a learning exercise. Playing around in the world of webscraping is quite enjoyable, and I've used a handful of new tools on this project, and I plan to implement a bunch more. The end goal is to create the most robust and quick web scraper for Instagram that is out there. 

The version that I did using CasperJS/SlimerJS was quite quick, though hard to maintain. It had a number of issues with logins and the like, so it wasn't ideal. The current version made with Selenium in C# is much, much more maintainable and likely better overall, though it is a bit slower. I've tried to make it compatible with Chrome and FireFox, but FireFox just has too many issues, and is much slower than Chrome, so I likely won't be trying to make sure it's still usable any more. I am keeping it for now, just in case I do need it for something.

I might still branch into F# and canopy, though anything further is currently not planned.
